INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Setup a virtualhostblock in httpd.conf, like this:

<VirtualHost 213.237.118.52>
	ServerName   gallery.yourdomain.dk
	DocumentRoot /data/pictures/
	ErrorLog     logs/gallery-error_log
	TransferLog  logs/gallery-access_log
	PerlSetVar   GalleryTemplateDir '/usr/local/apache/gallery/templates'
	PerlSetVar   InlineDir '/usr/local/apache/Inline'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryInfo 'Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash' 
	PerlSetVar   GallerySizes '640 1024 1600 2272'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryCopyrightImage 'htdocs/c.png'
	<Location />
		SetHandler        perl-script
		PerlHandler       Apache::Gallery
	</Location>
</VirtualHost>

Example of other stuff you can put on the GalleryInfo line:
'Camera => Model'

You can also put ie:
PerlSetVar   GallerySizes '640 800'

in a .htaccess file if you want other settings for that directory.

Copy the files from templates/ to where you pointed GalleryTemplateDir to,
copy htdocs/folder.png to your Apache icons directory and copy htdocs/gallery.css
to the DocumentRoot of your gallery.

Create /usr/local/apache/Inline and make sure your httpd can write to this
directory. This will be used by the Inline module to compile the c-code used
to access functions in Imlib2

It is possible to include a graphical copyright notice on each picture now.
By setting the GalleryCopyrightImage PerlSetVar you can define the path
to a picture that you want include in the left top of each picture.

Apache::Gallery now has support for rotating pictures on the fly. To use
this functionality you have to create file with the name of the picture
you want rotated appened with ".rotate". The file should include a number
where these numbers are supported:
"1", rotates clockwise by 90 degree
"2", rotates clockwise by 180 degrees
"3", rotates clockwise by 270 degrees
So if we want to rotate "Picture1234.jpg" 90 degrees clockwise we would
create a file in the same directory called "Picture1234.jpg.rotate" with
the number 1 inside of it.

To include comments for each picture you create a picture.jpg.comment
file that can include a first line of:
TITLE: This is the new title of the page
And this is the comment.
