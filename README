NAME
    Apache::Gallery - mod_perl handler to create an image gallery

SYNOPSIS
    See the INSTALL file in the distribution for installation instructions.

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::Gallery creates an thumbnail index of each directory and allows
    viewing pictures in different resolutions. Pictures are resized on the
    fly and cached. The gallery can be configured and customized in many
    ways and a custom copyright image can be added to all the images without
    modifying the original.

CONFIGURATION
    In your httpd.conf you set the global options for the gallery. You can
    also override each of the options in .htaccess files in your gallery
    directories.

    The options are set in the httpd.conf/.htaccess file using the syntax:
    PerlSetVar OptionName 'value'

    Example: PerlSetVar InlineDir '/tmp/inline'

    InlineDir
        Full path to the directory Inline should compile the inline c-code
        and store the shared objects. This is also where you can find debug
        information if the c-code fails to compile.

        Defaults to '/tmp'

    GalleryTemplateDir
        Full path to the directory where you placed the templates. This
        option can be used both in your global configuration and in
        .htaccess files, this way you can have different layouts in
        different parts of your gallery.

        No default value, this option is required.

    GalleryInfo
        With this option you can define which EXIF information you would
        like to present from the image. The format is: '<MyName =>
        KeyInEXIF, MyOtherName => OtherKeyInEXIF'

        Examples of keys: ShutterSpeedValue, ApertureValue, SubjectDistance,
        and Camera

        You can view all the keys from the EXIF header using this
        perl-oneliner:

        perl "-e" 'use Data::Dumper; use Image::Info qw(image_info); print
        Dumper(image_info(shift));' filename.jpg

        Default is: 'Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash'

    GallerySizes
        Defines which widths images can be scaled to. Images cannot be
        scaled to other widths than the ones you define with this option.

        The default is '640 1024 1600 2272'

    GalleryThumbnailSize
        Defines the width and height of the thumbnail images.

        Defaults to '100x75'

    GalleryCopyrightImage
        Image you want to blend into your images in the lower right corner.
        This could be a transparent png saying "copyright my name 2001".

        Optional.

    GalleryWrapNavigation
        Make the navigation in the picture view wrap around (So Next at the
        end displays the first picture, etc.)

        Set to 1 or 0, default is 0

    GalleryAllowOriginal
        Allow the user to download the Original picture without resizing or
        putting the CopyrightImage on it.

        Set to 1 or 0, default is 0

FEATURES
    Rotate images
        Pictures can be rotated on the fly without modifying the original
        image.

        To use this functionality you have to create file with the name of
        the picture you want rotated appened with ".rotate". The file should
        include a number where these numbers are supported:

                "1", rotates clockwise by 90 degree
                "2", rotates clockwise by 180 degrees
                "3", rotates clockwise by 270 degrees

        So if we want to rotate "Picture1234.jpg" 90 degrees clockwise we
        would create a file in the same directory called
        "Picture1234.jpg.rotate" with the number 1 inside of it.

    Comments
        To include comments for each picture you create files called
        picture.jpg.comment where the first line can contain "TITLE: New
        title" which will be the title of the page, and a comment on the
        following lines.

        Example: TITLE: This is the new title of the page And this is the
        comment.<br> And this is line two of the comment.
