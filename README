NAME
    Apache::Gallery - mod_perl handler to create an image gallery

SYNOPSIS
    See the INSTALL file in the distribution for installation instructions.

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::Gallery creates an thumbnail index of each directory and allows
    viewing pictures in different resolutions. Pictures are resized on the
    fly and cached. The gallery can be configured and customized in many
    ways and a custom copyright image can be added to all the images without
    modifying the original.

CONFIGURATION
    In your httpd.conf you set the global options for the gallery. You can
    also override each of the options in .htaccess files in your gallery
    directories.

    The options are set in the httpd.conf/.htaccess file using the syntax:
    PerlSetVar OptionName 'value'

    Example: PerlSetVar GalleryCacheDir '/var/tmp/Apache-Gallery/'

    GalleryAutoRotate
        Some cameras, like the Canon G3, can detect the orientation of a the
        pictures you take and will save this information in the
        'Orientation' EXIF field. Apache::Gallery will then automatically
        rotate your images.

        This behavior is default but can be disabled by setting
        GalleryAutoRotate to 0.

    GalleryCacheDir
        Directory where Apache::Gallery should create its cache with scaled
        pictures. The default is /var/tmp/Apache-Gallery/ . Here, a
        directory for each virtualhost or location will be created
        automaticly. Make sure your webserver has write access to the
        CacheDir.

    GalleryTemplateDir
        Full path to the directory where you placed the templates. This
        option can be used both in your global configuration and in
        .htaccess files, this way you can have different layouts in
        different parts of your gallery.

        No default value, this option is required.

    GalleryInfo
        With this option you can define which EXIF information you would
        like to present from the image. The format is: '<MyName =>
        KeyInEXIF, MyOtherName => OtherKeyInEXIF'

        Examples of keys: ShutterSpeedValue, ApertureValue, SubjectDistance,
        and Camera

        You can view all the keys from the EXIF header using this
        perl-oneliner:

        perl "-e" 'use Data::Dumper; use Image::Info qw(image_info); print
        Dumper(image_info(shift));' filename.jpg

        Default is: 'Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash'

    GallerySizes
        Defines which widths images can be scaled to. Images cannot be
        scaled to other widths than the ones you define with this option.

        The default is '640 800 1024 1600'

    GalleryThumbnailSize
        Defines the width and height of the thumbnail images.

        Defaults to '100x75'

    GalleryThumbnailSizeLS
        If set to '1', GalleryThumbnailSize is the long and the short side
        of the thumbnail image instead of the width and height.

        Defaults to '0'.

    GalleryCopyrightImage
        Image you want to blend into your images in the lower right corner.
        This could be a transparent png saying "copyright my name 2001".

        Optional.

    GalleryWrapNavigation
        Make the navigation in the picture view wrap around (So Next at the
        end displays the first picture, etc.)

        Set to 1 or 0, default is 0

    GalleryAllowOriginal
        Allow the user to download the Original picture without resizing or
        putting the CopyrightImage on it.

        Set to 1 or 0, default is 0

    GallerySlideshowIntervals
        With this option you can configure which intervals can be selected
        for a slideshow. The default is '3 5 10 15 30'

    GallerySortBy
        Instead of the default filename ordering you can sort by any stat
        attribute. For example size, atime, mtime, ctime.

    GalleryDirSortBy
        Set this variable to sort directories differently than other items,
        can be set to size, atime, mtime and ctime; setting any other value
        will revert to sorting by name.

    GalleryMemoize
        Cache EXIF data using Memoize - this will make Apache::Gallery
        faster when many people access the same images, but it will also
        cache EXIF data until the current Apache child dies.

    GalleryUseFileDate
        Set this option to 1 to make A::G show the files timestamp instead
        of the EXIF value for "Picture taken".

    GallerySelectionMode
        Enable the selection mode. Select images with checkboxes and get a
        list of filenames.

    GalleryEXIFMode
        You can choose how Apache::Gallery should display EXIF info from
        your images.

        The default setting is 'namevalue'. This setting will make
        Apache::Gallery print out the names and values of the EXIF values
        you configure with GalleryInfo. The information will be parsed into
        $INFO in pictureinfo.tpl.

        You can also set it to 'values' which will make A::G parse the
        configured values into the var $EXIFVALUES as 'value | value |
        value'

        If you set this option to 'variables' the items you configure in
        GalleryInfo will be available to your templates as $EXIF_<KEYNAME>
        (in all uppercase). That means that with the default setting
        "Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash" you will have
        the variables $EXIF_DATETIMEORIGINAL and $EXIF_FLASH avilable to
        your templates. You can place them anywhere you want.

    GalleryRootPath
        Change the location of gallery root. The default is ""

    GalleryRootText
        Change the name that appears as the root element in the menu. The
        default is "root:"

    GalleryMaxThumbnailsPerPage
        This options controls how many thumbnails should be displayed in a
        page. It requires $BROWSELINKS to be in the index.tpl template file.

    GalleryImgFile
        Pattern matching the files you want Apache::Gallery to view in the
        index as thumbnails.

        The default is '\.(jpe?g|png|tiff?|ppm)$'

    GalleryDocFile
        Pattern matching the files you want Apache::Gallery to view in the
        index as normal files. All other filetypes will still be served by
        Apache::Gallery but are not visible in the index.

        The default is
        '\.(mpe?g|avi|mov|asf|wmv|doc|mp3|ogg|pdf|rtf|wav|dlt|html?|csv|eps)
        $'

    GalleryTTFDir
        To use the GalleryCopyrightText feature you must set this option to
        the directory where your True Type fonts are stored. No default is
        set.

        Example:

                PerlSetVar      GalleryTTFDir '/usr/share/fonts/'

    GalleryTTFFile
        To use the GalleryCopyrightText feature this option must be set to
        the name of the True Type font you wish to use. Example:

                PerlSetVar      GalleryTTFFile 'verdanab.ttf'

    GalleryTTFSize
        Configure the size of the CopyrightText that will be inserted as
        copyright notice in the corner of your pictures.

        Example:

                PerlSetVar      GalleryTTFSize '10'

    GalleryCopyrightText
        The text that will be inserted as copyright notice.

        Example:

                PerlSetVar      GalleryCopyrightText '(c) Michael Legart'

    GalleryCopyrightColor
        The text color of your copyright notice.

        Examples:

        White: PerlSetVar GalleryCopyrightColor '255,255,255,255'

        Black: PerlSetVar GalleryCopyrightColor '0,0,0,255'

        Red: PerlSetVar GalleryCopyrightColor '255,0,0,255'

        Green: PerlSetVar GalleryCopyrightColor '0,255,0,255'

        Blue: PerlSetVar GalleryCopyrightColor '0,0,255,255'

        Transparent orange: PerlSetVar GalleryCopyrightColor '255,127,0,127'

    GalleryCopyrightBackgroundColor
        The background-color of a GalleryCopyrightText

        r,g,b,a - for examples, see GalleryCopyrightColor

    GalleryQuality
        The quality (1-100) of scaled images

        This setting affects the quality of the scaled images. Set this to a
        low number to reduce the size of the scaled images. Remember to
        clear out your cache if you change this setting. Quality seems to
        default to 75, at least in the jpeg and png loader code in Imlib2
        1.1.0.

        Examples:

        Quality at 50: PerlSetVar GalleryQuality '50'

    GalleryUnderscoresToSpaces
        Set this option to 1 to convert underscores to spaces in the listing
        of directory names.

    GalleryCommentExifKey
    Set this option to e.g. ImageDescription to use this field as comments
    for images.

    GalleryEnableMediaRss
    Set this option to 1 to enable generation of a media RSS feed. This can
    be used e.g. together with the PicLens plugin from http://piclens.com

FEATURES
    Rotate images
        Some cameras, like the Canon G3, detects the orientation of a
        picture and adds this info to the EXIF header. Apache::Gallery
        detects this and automaticly rotates images with this info.

        If your camera does not support this, you can rotate the images
        manually, This can also be used to override the rotate information
        from a camera that supports that. You can also disable this behavior
        with the GalleryAutoRotate option.

        To use this functionality you have to create file with the name of
        the picture you want rotated appened with ".rotate". The file should
        include a number where these numbers are supported:

                "1", rotates clockwise by 90 degree
                "2", rotates clockwise by 180 degrees
                "3", rotates clockwise by 270 degrees

        So if we want to rotate "Picture1234.jpg" 90 degrees clockwise we
        would create a file in the same directory called
        "Picture1234.jpg.rotate" with the number 1 inside of it.

    Comments
        To include comments for a directory you create a <directory>.comment
        file where the first line can contain "TITLE: New title" which will
        be the title of the page, and a comment on the following lines. To
        include comments for each picture you create files called
        picture.jpg.comment where the first line can contain "TITLE: New
        title" which will be the title of the page, and a comment on the
        following lines.

        Example:

                TITLE: This is the new title of the page
                And this is the comment.<br />
                And this is line two of the comment.

        The visible name of the folder is by default identical to the name
        of the folder, but can be changed by creating a file
        <directory>.folder with the visible name of the folder.

        It is also possible to set GalleryCommentExifKey to the name of an
        EXIF field containing the comment, e.g. ImageDescription. The EXIF
        comment is overridden by the .comment file if it exists.
