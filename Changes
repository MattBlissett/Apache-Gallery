	- Made Inline dir configurable. (Tim Coleman)
	- Made it configurable which information about the image
	  should be viewed. (Thomas Eibner)

	  resolutions the user can scale between. The Gallery
	  will not allow scaling to 641x480 if you only configured
	  640x480. (To prevent evil people filling up your disk) (Me)

	  (Usefull if your browser times out the first time you
		visit a new gallery)
