INSTALLATION

Before you start installing Apache::Gallery you need to check
that you have the following installed:

- Perl 5.6
- Apache with mod_perl
- Apache::Request
- URI::Escape
- Image::Info
- Image::Size
- CGI::FastTemplate
- Inline::C
- X11 libraries (ie, XFree86)
- Imlib2 (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/enlightenment/imlib2-1.0.3.tar.gz)

When installing Imlib2 from rpm, deb or other packages formats, remember
that you need the imlib2-dev package too. On Debian this can be installed
with:

apt-get install libimlib2-dev

Then, to install Apache::Gallery run the following commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Setup a virtualhostblock in httpd.conf, like this:

<VirtualHost 123.123.123.123>
	ServerName   gallery.yourdomain.org
	DocumentRoot /data/pictures/
	ErrorLog     logs/gallery-error_log
	TransferLog  logs/gallery-access_log
	PerlSetVar   GalleryTemplateDir '/usr/local/apache/gallery/templates'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryInfo 'Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash' 
	PerlSetVar   GallerySizes '640 1024 1600 2272'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryThumbnailSize '100x75'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryCopyrightImage 'htdocs/c.png'
	<Location />
		SetHandler        perl-script
		PerlHandler       Apache::Gallery
	</Location>
</VirtualHost>

Copy the files from templates/ to where you pointed GalleryTemplateDir to,
copy htdocs/folder.png and htdocs/video-*.png to your Apache icons 
directory and copy htdocs/gallery.css to the DocumentRoot of your gallery.

Create /usr/local/apache/Inline and make sure your httpd can write to this
directory. This will be used by the Inline module to compile the c-code used
to access functions in Imlib2

It is possible to include a graphical copyright notice on each picture now.
By setting the GalleryCopyrightImage PerlSetVar you can define the path
to a picture that you want include in the bottom right of each picture.
