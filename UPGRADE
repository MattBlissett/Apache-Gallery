have been added and should be copied to our Apache icons
directory.

For users upgrading from 0.5 to 0.5.1

InlineDir is no longer honored, File::Spec is used to find a temporary
directory (usually /tmp)
Since 0.5, your .cache subdirectories are no longer used and can be
safely deleted. All cached images are now kept in
/var/tmp/Apache-Gallery/ unless you set GalleryCacheDir.

For users upgrading from 0.4 to 0.5

Remember to update the following templates:
templates/interval.tpl
templates/intervalactive.tpl
templates/layout.tpl
templates/refresh.tpl
templates/scaleactive.tpl
templates/showpicture.tpl
templates/slideshowisoff.tpl
templates/slideshowoff.tpl
templates/pictureinfo.tpl
templates/nopictureinfo.tpl

A new option has been added:

PerlSetVar	GalleryCacheDir '/var/tmp/Apache-Gallery/'

GalleryCacheDir is optional but you can use it to decide
where Apache::Gallery should place the scaled pictures.

For users upgrading from 0.3 to 0.4:

Two new options have been added, they are both optional:

PerlSetVar   GalleryThumbnailSize '100x75'
PerlSetVar   GalleryCopyrightImage 'htdocs/c.png'

The templates and the htdocs/gallery.css file has been updated
so remember to copy them to your template dir and documentroot!

To use the new movie feature make sure you add the movie.tpl file
to your templates dir and copy the video-* files from htdocs to
your apache icons directory.

For users upgrading from 0.2 to 0.3:

There has been som changes to the templates. info.tpl and scale.tpl
were added and showpicture.tpl was changed a little.

InlineDir, imageinfo and imagesizes have been made configurable,
so please add

PerlSetVar   InlineDir '/usr/local/apache/Inline'
PerlSetVar   GalleryInfo 'Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash' 
PerlSetVar   GallerySizes '640 1024 1600 2272'

to your virtualhost.
