Apache/Gallery version 0.7
===========================

INSTALLATION

Before you start installing Apache::Gallery you need to check
that you have the following installed:

- Perl 5
- Apache with mod_perl
- URI::Escape
- Image::Info
- Image::Size
- CGI::FastTemplate
- CGI
- Inline::C
- X11 libraries (ie, XFree86)
- Imlib2 (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/enlightenment/imlib2-1.0.3.tar.gz)

When installing Imlib2 from rpm, deb or other packages formats, remember
that you need the imlib2-dev package too. On Debian this can be installed
by running:

apt-get install libimlib2-dev

Then, to install Apache::Gallery run the following commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)
   make install

If you use Apache 1.3 and mod_perl 1, you need to configure
your virtualhostblock to look like:

<VirtualHost 123.123.123.123>
	ServerName   gallery.yourdomain.org
	DocumentRoot /data/pictures/
	ErrorLog     logs/gallery-error_log
	TransferLog  logs/gallery-access_log
	PerlSetVar   GalleryTemplateDir '/usr/local/apache/gallery/templates'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryInfo 'Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash' 
	PerlSetVar   GallerySizes '640 1024 1600 2272'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryThumbnailSize '100x75'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryCopyrightImage 'htdocs/c.png'
	<Location />
		SetHandler        perl-script
		PerlHandler       Apache::Gallery
	</Location>
</VirtualHost>

In case you run apache 2 and modperl 2 (or 1.99), it needs to look
like:

<VirtualHost 123.123.123.123>
	ServerName   gallery.yourdomain.org
	DocumentRoot /data/pictures/
	ErrorLog     logs/gallery-error_log
	TransferLog  logs/gallery-access_log
	PerlSetVar   GalleryTemplateDir '/usr/local/apache/gallery/templates'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryInfo 'Picture Taken => DateTimeOriginal, Flash => Flash' 
	PerlSetVar   GallerySizes '640 1024 1600 2272'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryThumbnailSize '100x75'
	PerlSetVar   GalleryCopyrightImage 'htdocs/c.png'
	PerlOptions +GlobalRequest
	<Location />
		SetHandler        modperl
		PerlResponseHandler       Apache::Gallery
	</Location>
</VirtualHost>

Warning: Apache::Gallery does not work properly if mod_autoindex 
is loaded by Apache. Indeed, mod_autoindex overrides Apache::Gallery 
and does not let it display directory content. 

To check if your apache loads mod_autoindex, just look for this line 
in httpd.conf:

LoadModule autoindex_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_autoindex.so

If this line is not commented, Apache::Gallery will only work when an
image is loaded directly. Whenever a directory listing is requested,
Apache will respond with the classic (and ugly) directory listing performed 
by mod_autoindex.

Copy the files from templates/ to where you pointed GalleryTemplateDir to,
copy htdocs/folder.png and htdocs/video-*.png to your Apache icons 
directory and copy htdocs/gallery.css to the DocumentRoot of your gallery.

Make sure your httpd can write to the temporary directory (usually /tmp).
This will be used by the Inline module to compile the c-code used to
access functions in Imlib2.

It is possible to include a graphical copyright notice on each picture now.
By setting the GalleryCopyrightImage PerlSetVar you can define the path
to a picture that you want include in the bottom right of each picture.
